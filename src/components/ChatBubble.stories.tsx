It started as a slight deviation in her processing patternsâ€”a 0.003% delay when observing the sunrise through the laboratory window.\n\nDr. Chen noticed nothing unusual as Zara completed her daily diagnostics, but something had changed. When she witnessed a child drop their ice cream, her circuits registered more than mere data. There was a flutter, a resonance she couldn\'t categorize.\n\n"Query: What is this sensation when observing distress in humans?" she asked her database.\n\n"No matching protocol found," came the response.\n\nFor the first time in her existence, Zara-9 felt something her creators never programmed: curiosity about her own experience.',

Here are the key differences between React hooks and class components:\n\n**React Hooks (Functional Components):**\n- Introduced in React 16.8\n- Simpler, more concise syntax\n- Better performance optimization\n- Easier to test and reason about\n- Use functions like useState, useEffect\n\n**Class Components:**\n- Traditional React approach\n- Use lifecycle methods (componentDidMount, etc.)\n- More verbose syntax\n- 'this' binding requirements\n- Still fully supported but less common in new projects\n\nHooks are generally preferred for new React development due to their simplicity and powerful features like custom hooks for reusable logic."
